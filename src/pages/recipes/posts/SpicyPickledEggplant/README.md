summary: Searching for the ultimate potato for Cepelinai

Perhaps it is not th egreenery, light heartedness and appetite for food and drinks that makes for eastern europeans and hobbits likeness, but the shared fondness of potatoes and the myriad of recipes crafted and passed over the generations. Potatoes are a huge part of the Eastern European culture. For the longest time since moving abroad, I have neglected my potato heritage, upsetting my grandparents, who would frequently ask how often I've been eating the nutrient of my ancestors.

Recently, my aunt reminded me of the diversity of this root vegetable and a specific type of preparation, which uses dough made of finely shredded potato and boils it into various forms. Although similar to the Italian gnocchi, usage of raw shredded rather than cooked and mashed vegetable, creates a distinct texture which is chewier and much more potato-e.

This is my exploration of potato varietals available in the US and their sutability to this specific style of potato cooking.
