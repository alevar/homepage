# Challenge
This begins hopefully a series on this blog describing my process of creating complete dishes and pairings utilizing specific ingredients picked by my girlfriend as the stars of the show.

For the first challenge, almonds were presented to me as my challenge - honestly I was expecting something much different. After a brief falter, my brain got to work and quickly organized a few ideas based on inspirations from european and middleeastern/persian cusines.

We really like polenta. Even though I was not able to crack the secrets of polenta fries just yet, the dish is a frequently returning side on our table. Well, corn is yellow and sweet, and so are almonds - so why not combine their toasty flavors together? That was idea 1.

For the main course I was inspired by famous pistachio crusted lamb chops. I had an abundance of almond flour on hand, and thought using an herb-infused crust on some thiccck pork chops might be a great pairing. I added some koji to prepare the chops covered in koji for 2 days first before cooking them to infuse them through and through with those special umami flavors. The choice of herb fell on marjoram as a more subtle pairing for meats.

Lastly, for desert, frangipane tarts were an obvious choice due to how strong the flavor of the almonds is in the dish. However, to make it fun, I thought almonds might work well with saffron as a flavor pairing. Topped with some neutral fruits like peaches and/or oranges.

Alas, this dish while splendid and very memorable, definitely on my top creations thus far, was cooked during an extremely turmolous time in my life and was not properly documented. I really hope when the dust is settled I may return to repeat it once more and properly document the process and make it available for all to try and help develop.
