summary: Village Autumn Morning Apple Cake
---

Learning my family recipe for an apple cake, my grandma used to bake every few days from fresh apples in the village. The magical sweet vannila-y scent of fresh baked apples is a distant warm happy memory. Each room in our village house was shared a corner of the great wood-fire oven. As my grandmar would cook breakfast and dinner in the oven it would warm up each corner of the house during the colder months. Not sure how my grandma would keep the house from feeling like a furnace during the warmer months though.

Regardless, the magical moment of waking up on one of the first days of the summer vacation, sun finally illuminating everything around yourself, with no burden of homeworks to worry about, the entire summer ahead of yourself, adventures in the forrest awaiting. And my grandmother would wake me up with a beautiful fresh cake.

Now that I think about it, it must have been the end of the summer, since the earliest apples would show up in August, but this is how I remember that feeling - carefree joy, sun, freedom and my grandmas apple cake.

I finally got my mom and my grandma to revise this recipe and prepare the recipe with their annotations for my use. I am hoping to also supplement this recipe with a variation from my grand aunt.

My moms recipe:

1. форму змазала маргарынам (можна маслам). Яблыкі лепш кіслыя
1. spread margarine (could use butter). Sour apples are best

2. Цеста: 3 яйкі, 1 шклянка (200г) цукру (лепш менш, калі яблыкі не кіслыя), 2-3 сталовыя лыжкі смятаны, 1 шклянка (прыкладна 160г) мукі, 1 чайная лыжка (5г) соды (гасіла воцатам) ( можна замяніць разрыхліцелем цеста, але я не спрабавала). Цеста мусіць па кансістэнцыі быць, як густая смятана
2. Batter. 3 eggs, 1 cup (200g) sugar (less is better if the appleas are not sour). 2-3 tablespoons of sourcream, 1 cup (160g) of flour, 1 teaspoon (5g) baking soda (reacted with vinegar) (can be substituted with baking poder, but I haven't tried). The batter must be similar consistency to thick sour cream.

3. запекала пры 180 - 200 градусах хвілін 35, але ж гэта залежыць ад формы
3. bake at 18-200 degrees celcius for 35 minutes, but the timing depends on the pan

4. Цеста я міксую ў камбайне: ўсё паступова дадаю, спачатку яйкі з цукрам, потым смятану, муку, соду (ці разрыхліцелем разам з мукой). Мне так прасцей, але натуральна, што можна і рукамі
4. The batter I prepare in a mixer: add all ingredients one-by-one, first eggs with sugar, then sour cream, flour, baking soda (or baking powder with flour). I find this easier, naturally, but could be prepared by hand.
