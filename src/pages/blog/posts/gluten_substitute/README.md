# Intro
Gluten serves a fundamental role in the culinary world - helping maintain the airy and strong structure in our favorite doughy goods. Alas, not everyone is graced to enjoy this common delicacy. That begs the question: is it possible to manually construct the same protein matrix using a different polymer with properties similar to those of gluten? Afterall, we can beat albumin in eggwhites or aquafaba into stable meringues, use gelatin to set our favorite wobbly deserts. many other stabilizing culinary techniques have been created.

Similarly, gluten itself can quite easily be isolated out of the wheat flour by washing the dough to retain plain seitan.

This begs the question, is it possible ot find a substance with stabilizing properties of gluten which can be introduced into other flours such as rice or tapioca or otato flour, to create stretchy structure?

What if we could obtain the molecular structure of the gluten protein, use state-of-the-art folding techniques to estimate the 3D structure of the protein and then search for similar known proteins using FoldSeek? Having identified suitable candidates, we could then run some yummy kitchen experiments to attempt fortifying rice or potato flours with the newly discovered agents in the hope of creating elastic doughs akin to wheat products.
